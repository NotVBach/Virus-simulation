## Introduction 

* This is the project of Group 8, **Subject Modeling and simulation of complex systems**, focusing on simluate Virus spreading behaviors in difference scenarios.
* Since I'm suck at handling large files, all the assets will be tranfered to Google Drive via: [Includes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19FQTeO65CSfLlaO_saC4m3R5KiC59WQn/view?usp=sharing)
